# VBA-challenge - The VBA of Wall Street


Stock market analysis

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:


  The ticker symbol;


  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year;


  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year;


  The total stock volume of the stock.


Applied conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red using VBA coding.



The script returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
